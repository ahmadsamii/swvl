### Promo Scheduler ###

Promo Scheduler is a simple shell script that invokes a Node script to fetch promos against Users data and populates them in another database collection.


#### How to Execute ####

Configure the database details and Users data file in `config/default.json` and start the bash script with `./scheduler.sh`.
If script execution is not started, make sure the script permissions are correctly set to executable.
